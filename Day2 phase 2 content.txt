POLYMOPHISM
one item or same item used for different purpose.
TYPES
1.overloading
---operator overloading
eg:5+10=15

----method overloading
2.overiding
if  a method uds defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base class or parents class
 
DATA STRUCTURE
data structure helps to write efficient programs
linear -----array,linked list,stack,queue,matrix
non-linear----binry tree,heap,hashtable,graph
linear---storing data sequentially
non linear--no sequential style required

static----size cannot be changed----array
dynamic----list,stack,queue

linked list-----real time example train
as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list
types
single or singly linked list
double or doubly linked list
circular linked list

CREATING LINKED LIST
step 1:create the node
step 2:partition the node with 2 segments data and none
step 3:add value into the blank node
step 4:mark the node as head
step 5:create the next node by following the above steps
step 6:establish link between first node and the second node

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST
traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list
