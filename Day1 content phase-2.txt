LAMBDA FUNCTION
it is called as anonymous function when we wnat to use function concept alone without using function name,there we apply concept of lambda function.

4 pillars of oops
1.abstraction
2.inheritance
3.encapsulation
4.polymorphism

abstraction
hiding the implementation part showing what is required for the users is called as abstraction ex:exe file
we can make class or method as abstract,opposite to abstract is concrete which means 

encapsulation
binding data and function into the single entity
public------ onec class into can be accessed by any other class
private------ can be used where it bis declared /no in inheritected class
protected---can be accessed only where it got declared______which ever class is inherited there also we can use.

inheritance
base class and derived class
derived class will inherit properties of base class

base class-parent class
derived class-child class

TYPES OF INHERITANCE
1.SINGLE INHERITANCE
2.MULTIPLE  INHERITANCE
3.MULTI-LEVEL  INHERITANCE
4.HIERARCHIAL  INHERITANCE
5.HYBRID  INHERITANCE
